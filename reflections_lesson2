git commands

git clone [http address of repository]
	-saves files onto your drive in the folder that you were in when you made the command

git log
	-gives log of all commits made on a repository (i assume you have to be in the directory of a repository for it to work)

	-shows additions and deletions between two commits based on commit id (found in git log)

git checkout [id]
	-checks out a commit so that it is now the active file
